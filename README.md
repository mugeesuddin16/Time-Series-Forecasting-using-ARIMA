# Time Series Forecasting using ARIMA  
Predicting Future Stock Prices with ARIMA  

## üöÄ Project Overview  
This repository demonstrates how to apply the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model for forecasting future stock prices using historical data. Leveraging the power of time-series modelling, we walk through the full workflow from data collection to model building, evaluation and prediction. Inspired by the tutorial ‚ÄúTime Series Forecasting with ARIMA‚Äù by Aman Kharwal. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

## üìå Why ARIMA?  
ARIMA is a well-established statistical algorithm for time-series forecasting. It consists of three parameters (p, d, q):  
- **p** = number of lagged terms (autoregressive part) :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  
- **d** = number of times data needs differencing to make it stationary :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  
- **q** = size of the moving average window (error terms) :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}  

When the data is **stationary**, ARIMA is suitable; when seasonal effects dominate, you may need a seasonal extension (SARIMA) as discussed in the tutorial. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}

## üõ†Ô∏è Workflow / Steps  
1. **Data Collection**  
   - Fetch historical stock price data (e.g., via yfinance)  
   - Example code snippet:  
     ```python
     import yfinance as yf
     data = yf.download('GOOG', start='YYYY-MM-DD', end='YYYY-MM-DD', progress=False)
     ``` :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}  
   - Select relevant columns (Date + Close price) for modelling. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}  
   
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Plot the time series to visually inspect trends and seasonality. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}  
   - Decompose the series into trend, seasonal, residual components using e.g. `seasonal_decompose`. :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}  
   
3. **Stationarity Check & Parameter Selection**  
   - If data shows non-stationarity or seasonality, consider differencing or SARIMA. :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}  
   - Use Autocorrelation Function (ACF) and Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF) plots to estimate p and q. :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}  
   - Example found in tutorial: p = 5, d = 1, q = 2. :contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}  
   
4. **Model Building & Training**  
   ```python
   from statsmodels.tsa.arima_model import ARIMA
   model = ARIMA(data["Close"], order=(p,d,q))
   fitted_model = model.fit(disp=-1)
   ``` :contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}  
   
5. **Prediction & Evaluation**  
   - Generate predictions (in‚Äêsample or out‚Äêof‚Äêsample) from the fitted model. :contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16}  
   - Compare with actuals, plot results for visual validation.  
   - If results are poor (especially for seasonal data), switch to SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA). :contentReference[oaicite:18]{index=18}  
   
6. **Future Forecasting**  
   - Use the model (ARIMA or SARIMA) to forecast future stock prices. Example in tutorial: forecast next 10 days. :contentReference[oaicite:19]{index=19}  
   - Visualise training data + predictions together. :contentReference[oaicite:20]{index=20}

üéØ **Key Outcomes**

You will learn how to structure a time-series forecasting workflow using ARIMA.

You‚Äôll gain hands-on experience with parameter selection (p, d, q), model fitting, and forecasting.

You‚Äôll understand when ARIMA works well ‚Äî and when seasonal data calls for SARIMA.

You‚Äôll build a reusable template for forecasting future stock prices (or other time-series data).

üß† **Things to Think About / Future Work**

Explore grid-searching p, d, q (and seasonal P, D, Q) for optimal model selection.

Compare ARIMA/SARIMA with machine-learning or deep-learning based time-series models (e.g., LSTM, Transformer).

Incorporate additional features (e.g., volume, market indicators) for multivariate forecasting.

Evaluate forecast accuracy using metrics (RMSE, MAE, MAPE) and incorporate back-testing.

Deploy the model as a live forecasting service or integrate into a dashboard.
